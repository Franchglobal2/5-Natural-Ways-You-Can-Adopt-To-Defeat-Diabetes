Take A Healthy Diet The food that we eat directly impacts our blood sugar levels; therefore, consuming the right kind of food will make you notice a great impact in your life. The ideal diet consists of healthy carbohydrates, fiber-rich food, heart-healthy food, and good fats, i.e., polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. The two main things that you need to keep in mind are that you must not consume food that causes a spike in insulin and you should not overeat at any cost.  Drink Plenty Of Water Considering the fact that water contributes to more than half of our body composition, staying hydrated is crucial for everyone. Staying hydrated dilutes the concentration of sugar in your bloodstream by eliminating excess glucose through urine. Mild dehydration is not something we would notice, but it impacts blood sugar levels, so always keep water with you and keep drinking it throughout the day.  Exercise Regularly Fitting in even 15-20 minutes of workout every day can improve your blood sugar level by a great deal. When you work out, the glucose from your bloodstream is pushed into cells, resulting in a better blood sugar level. You can start with simple things like walking at a fast pace, cycling, and even dancing to your favorite songs. Staying fit by exercising regularly can help you keep your glucose and sugar levels in control.  Practice Relaxation Stress directly relates to blood sugar levels, because when you are stressed your body produces a hormone called epinephrine which leads to an increase in blood sugar levels. Therefore, it’s important to be relaxed. Relaxation techniques like breathing, meditation and progressive muscle relaxation are very effective to get instant relief from stress. Sleep affects our stress levels, so make sure you get enough sleep.
